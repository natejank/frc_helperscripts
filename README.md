# FRC Helper scripts

These are a collection of python scripts to pull data from The Blue Alliance.  They are designed to have 0 dependencies, only using the python standard library!

These are also designed to be self-contained, so they can be used outside of this project.

This project is powered by The Blue Alliance, but is not associated with them in any way.
