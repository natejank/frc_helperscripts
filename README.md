# FRC Helper scripts

These are a collection of python scripts to pull data from The Blue Alliance.  While they are designed to have as few dependencies as possible, they rely on requests for http support.

These are also designed to be self-contained, so they can be used outside of this project.

This project is powered by The Blue Alliance, but is not associated with them in any way.
